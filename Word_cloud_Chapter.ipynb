              "'The Book Of Joshua\\nThe Argument\\nIn this book the holy Ghost setteth most lively before eyes the\\naccomplishment of God’s promise, who as he promised by the mouth of\\nMoses, that a Prophet should be raised up unto the people like unto him,\\nwhom he willeth to obey, Deut. 18:15 : so he showeth himself here true in\\nhis promise, as at all other times, and after the death of Moses his faithful\\nservant, he raiseth up Joshua to be a ruler and governor over his people, that\\nneither they should be discouraged for lack of a captain, nor have occasion to\\ndistrust God’s promises hereafter. And because that Joshua might be\\nconfirmed in his vocation, and the people also might have none occasion to\\ngrudge, as though he were not approved of God: he is adorned with most\\nexcellent gifts and graces of God, both to govern the people with counsel,\\nand to defend them with strength, that he lacketh nothing which either\\nbelongeth to a valiant captain, or a faithful minister. So he overcometh all\\ndifficulties, and bringeth them into the land of Canaan: the which according\\nto God’s ordinance he divideth among the people and appointeth their\\nborders: he established laws and ordinances, and putteth them in\\nremembrance of God’s manifold benefits, assuring them of his grace and\\nfavor, if they obey God, and contrariwise of his plagues and vengeance, if\\nthey disobey him. This history doth represent Jesus Christ the true Joshua,\\nwho leadeth us into eternal felicity, which is signified unto us by this land of\\nCanaan. From the beginning of the Genesis to the end of this book are\\ncontained 2567 years. For from Adam unto the flood are 1656, from the\\nflood unto the departure of Abraham out of Chaldea 423, and from thence to\\nthe death of Joseph 290. So that the Genesis containeth 2369, Exodus 140,\\nthe other three books of Moses 40. Joshua 27. So the whole maketh 2576\\nyears.\\nJoshua 1 ................................................................................................................................ 3\\nJoshua 2 ................................................................................................................................ 5\\nJoshua 3 ................................................................................................................................ 7\\nJoshua 4 ................................................................................................................................ 9\\nJoshua 5 .............................................................................................................................. 11\\nJoshua 6 .............................................................................................................................. 13\\nJoshua 7 .............................................................................................................................. 16\\nJoshua 8 .............................................................................................................................. 19\\nJoshua 9 .............................................................................................................................. 22\\nJoshua 10 ............................................................................................................................ 25\\nJoshua 11 ............................................................................................................................ 29\\nJoshua 12 ............................................................................................................................ 31\\nJoshua 13 ............................................................................................................................ 33\\nJoshua 14 ............................................................................................................................ 36\\nJoshua 15 ............................................................................................................................ 38\\nJoshua 16 ............................................................................................................................ 42\\nJoshua 17 ............................................................................................................................ 43\\nJoshua 18 ............................................................................................................................ 45\\nJoshua 19 ............................................................................................................................ 48\\nJoshua 20 ............................................................................................................................ 52\\nJoshua 21 ............................................................................................................................ 53\\nJoshua 22 ............................................................................................................................ 56\\nJoshua 23 ............................................................................................................................ 60\\nJoshua 24 ............................................................................................................................ 62\\nJoshua 1\\n1 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, the Lord spake unto\\nJoshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,\\n2 Moses my servant is dead: now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and\\nall this people, unto the land which I give them, that is, to ye children of Israel.\\n3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, have I given you, as I\\nsaid unto Moses.\\n4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river\\nPerath: all the land of the Hittites, even unto the great Sea toward the going\\ndown of the sun, shall be your coast.\\n5 There shall not a man be able to withstand thee all the days of thy life: as I was\\nwith Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.\\n6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide the land\\nfor an inheritance, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.\\n7 Only be thou strong, and of a most valiant courage, that thou mayest observe\\nand do according to all the Law which Moses my servant hath commanded thee:\\nthou shalt not turn away from it to the right hand, nor to the left, that thou mayest\\nprosper whithersoever thou goest.\\n8 Let not this book of the Law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day\\nand night, that thou mayest observe and do according to all that is written\\ntherein: for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then shalt thou have\\ngood success.\\n9 Have not I commanded thee, saying, Be strong and of a good courage, fear\\nnot, nor be discouraged? For I the Lord thy God will be with thee, whithersoever\\nthou goest.\\n10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,\\n11 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you\\nvitailles: for after three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess\\nthe land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it.\\n12 And unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of\\nManasseh spake Joshua, saying,\\n13 Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you,\\nsaying, The Lord your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.\\n14 Your wives, your children, and your cattle shall remain in the land which\\nMoses gave you on this side Jordan: but ye shall go over before your brethren\\narmed, all that be men of war, and shall help them,\\n15 Until the Lord have given your brethren rest, as well as to you, and until they\\nalso shall possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth them: then shall ye\\nreturn unto the land of your possession and shall possess it, which land Moses\\nthe Lord’s servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sun rising.\\n16 Then they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us, we will\\ndo, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.\\n17 As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee: only the Lord thy God\\nbe with thee, as he was with Moses.\\n18 Whosoever shall rebel against thy commandment, and will not obey thy words\\nin all that thou commandest him, let him be put to death: only be strong and of\\ngood courage.\\nJoshua 2\\n1 Then Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly,\\nsaying, Go, view the land, and also Jericho: and they went, and came into an\\nharlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.\\n2 Then report was made to the King of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men\\nhither tonight, of the children of Israel, to spy out the country.\\n3 And the King of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are\\ncome to thee, and which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search\\nout all the land.\\n4 (But ye woman had taken the two men, and hid them) Therefore said she thus,\\nThere came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were.\\n5 And when they shut the gate in the dark, the men went out, whither the men\\nwent I wot not: follow ye after them quickly, for ye shall overtake them.\\n6 (But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the\\nstalks of flax, which she had spread abroad upon the roof)\\n7 And certain men pursued after them, the way to Jordan, unto the fords, and as\\nsoon as they which pursued after them, were gone out, they shut the gate.\\n8 And before they were asleep, she came up unto them upon the roof,\\n9 And said unto the men, I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that\\nthe fear of you is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint\\nbecause of you.\\n10 For we have heard, how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before\\nyou, when you came out of Egypt, and what you did unto the two Kings of the\\nAmorites, that were on the other side Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye\\nutterly destroyed:\\n11 And when we heard it, our hearts did faint, and there remained no more\\ncourage in any because of you: for the Lord your God, he is the God in heaven\\nabove, and in earth beneath.\\n12 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord; that as I have shewed\\nyou mercy, ye will also shew mercy unto my father’s house, and give me a true\\ntoken,\\n13 And that ye will save alive my father and my mother, and my brethren, and my\\nsisters, and all that they have: and that ye will deliver our souls from death.\\n14 And the men answered her, Our life for you to die, if ye utter not this our\\nbusiness: and when the Lord hath given us the land, we will deal mercifully and\\ntruly with thee.\\n15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was\\nupon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.\\n16 And she said unto them, Go you into the mountain, lest the pursuers meet with\\nyou, and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: then\\nafterward may ye go your way.\\n17 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath, which thou\\nhast made us swear.\\n18 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this cord of red thread in\\nthe window, whereby thou lettest us down, and thou shalt bring thy father and thy\\nmother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household home to thee.\\n19 And whosoever then doeth go out at the doors of thine house into the street,\\nhis blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: but whosoever shall be\\nwith thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand touch him:\\n20 And if thou utter this our matter, we will be quit of thine oath, which thou hast\\nmade us swear.\\n21 And she answered, According unto your words, so be it: then she sent them\\naway, and they departed, and she bound the red cord in ye window.\\n22 And they departed, and came into the mountain, and there abode three days,\\nuntil the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the\\nway, but found them not.\\n23 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed\\nover, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that came unto\\nthem.\\n24 Also they said unto Joshua, Surely the Lord hath delivered into our hands all\\nthe land: for even all the inhabitants of the country faint because of us.\\nJoshua 3\\n1 Then Joshua rose very early, and they removed from Shittim, and came to\\nJordan, he, and all the children of Israel, and lodged there, before they went\\nover.\\n2 And after three days the officers went throughout the host,\\n3 And commanded the people, saying, When ye see the Ark of the covenant of\\nthe Lord your God, and the Priests of the Levites bearing it, ye shall depart from\\nyour place, and go after it.\\n4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by\\nmeasure: ye shall not come near unto it, that ye may know the way, by the which\\nye shall go: for ye have not gone this way in times past.\\n5 (Now Joshua had said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the\\nLord will do wonders among you)\\n6 Also Joshua spake unto the Priests, saying, Take up the Ark of the covenant,\\nand go over before the people: so they took up the Ark of the covenant, and went\\nbefore the people.\\n7 Then the Lord said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the\\nsight of all Israel, which shall know, that as I was with Moses, so will I be with\\nthee.\\n8 Thou shalt therefore command the Priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant,\\nsaying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of Jordan, ye shall stand still\\nin Jordan.\\n9 Then Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words\\nof the Lord your God.\\n10 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and\\nthat he will certainly cast out before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the\\nHivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the\\nJebusites.\\n11 Behold, the Ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the world passeth before you\\ninto Jordan.\\n12 Now therefore take from among you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out\\nof every tribe a man.\\n13 And as soon as the soles of the feet of the Priests (that bear the Ark of the\\nLord God the Lord of all the world) shall stay in the waters of Jordan, the waters\\nof Jordan shall be cut off: for the waters that come from above, shall stand still\\nupon an heap.\\n14 Then when the people were departed from their tents to go over Jordan, the\\nPriests bearing the Ark of the Covenant, went before people.\\n15 And as they that bare the Ark came unto Jordan, and the feet of the Priests\\nthat bare the Ark were dipped in the brink of the water, (for Jordan useth to fill all\\nhis banks all the time of harvest)\\n16 Then the waters that came down from above, stayed and rose upon an heap\\nand departed far from the city of Adam, that was beside Zaretan: but the waters\\nthat came down toward the Sea of the wilderness, even the salt Sea, failed, and\\nwere cut off: so the people went right over against Jericho.\\n17 But the Priests that bare the Ark of the covenant of the Lord, stood dry within\\nJordan ready prepared, and all the Israelites went over dry, until all the people\\nwere gone clean over through Jordan.\\nJoshua 4\\n1 And when all the people were wholly gone over Jordan, (after the Lord had\\nspoken unto Joshua, saying,\\n2 Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,\\n3 And command you them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan,\\nout of the place where the Priests stood in a readiness, twelve stones, which ye\\nshall take away with you, and leave them in the lodging where you shall lodge\\nthis night)\\n4 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of\\nIsrael, out of every tribe a man,\\n5 And Joshua said unto them, Go over before the Ark of the Lord your God, even\\nthrough the midst of Jordan, and take up every man of you a stone upon his\\nshoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel,\\n6 That this may be a sign among you, that when your children shall ask their\\nfathers in time to come, saying, What mean you by these stones?\\n7 Then ye may answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the\\nArk of the covenant of the Lord: for when it passed through Jordan, the waters of\\nJordan were cut off: therefore these stones are a memorial unto the children of\\nIsrael forever.\\n8 Then ye children of Israel did even so as Joshua had commanded, and took up\\ntwelve stones out of the midst of Jordan as ye Lord had said unto Joshua,\\naccording to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them\\naway with them unto the lodging, and laid them down there.\\n9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the\\nfeet of the Priests, which bare the Ark of the covenant stood, and there have they\\ncontinued unto this day.\\n10 So the Priests, which bare ye Ark, stood in the midst of Jordan, until\\neverything was finished that ye Lord had commanded Joshua to say unto the\\npeople, according to all that Moses charged Joshua: then the people hasted and\\nwent over.\\n11 When all the people were clean passed over, the Ark of the Lord went over\\nalso, and the Priests before the people.\\n12 And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh\\nwent over before the children of Israel armed, as Moses had charged them.\\n13 Even forty thousand prepared for war, went before the Lord unto battle, into ye\\nplain of Jericho.\\n14 That day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared\\nhim, as they feared Moses all days of his life.\\n15 And the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying,\\n16 Command the Priests that bear ye Ark of the testimony, to come up out of\\nJordan.\\n17 Joshua therefore commanded the Priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.\\n18 And when the Priests that bare the Ark of the covenant of ye Lord were come\\nup out of the midst of Jordan, and as soon as the soles of the Priest’s feet were\\nset on the dry land, the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed\\nover all the banks thereof, as they did before.\\n19 So the people came up out of Jordan the tenth day of the first month, and\\npitched in Gilgal, in the Eastside of Jericho.\\n20 Also the twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in\\nGilgal.\\n21 And he spake unto ye children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask\\ntheir fathers in time to come, and say, What mean these stones?\\n22 Then ye shall shew your children, and say, Israel came over this Jordan on dry\\nland:\\n23 For the Lord your God dried up ye waters of Jordan before you, until ye were\\ngone over, as the Lord your God did the Red Sea, which he dried up before us,\\ntill we were gone over,\\n24 That all the people of the world may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty,\\nthat ye might fear the Lord your God continually.\\nJoshua 5\\n1 Now when all the Kings of the Amorites, which were beyond Jordan Westward,\\nand all the Kings of the Canaanites which were by the Sea, heard that the Lord\\nhad dried up the waters of Jordan before the children of Israel until they were\\ngone over, their hearts fainted: and there was no courage in them any more\\nbecause of the children of Israel.\\n2 That same time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and\\nreturn, and circumcise the sons of Israel the second time.\\n3 Then Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the sons of Israel in the\\nhill of the foreskins.\\n4 And this is the cause why Joshua circumcised all the people, even the males\\nthat came out of Egypt, because all the men of war were dead in the wilderness\\nby the way after they came out of Egypt.\\n5 For all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were\\nborn in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt, were not\\ncircumcised.\\n6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people\\nof the men of war that came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed\\nnot the voice of the Lord: unto whom the Lord sware, that he would not shew\\nthem the land, which the Lord had sworn unto their fathers, that he would give\\nus, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.\\n7 So their sons whom he raised up in their stead, Joshua circumcised: for they\\nwere uncircumcised, because they circumcised them not by the way.\\n8 And when they had made an end of circumcising all the people, they abode in\\nthe places in the camp till they were whole.\\n9 After, the Lord said unto Joshua, This day I have taken away the shame of\\nEgypt from you: wherefore he called the name of that place Gilgal, unto this day.\\n10 So the children of Israel abode in Gilgal, and kept ye feast of the Passover the\\nfourteenth day of the month at even in ye plain of Jericho.\\n11 And they did eat of the corn of the land, on the morrow after the Passover,\\nunleavened bread, and parched corn in the same day.\\n12 And the MANNA ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the corn of the\\nland, neither had the children of Israel MANNA any more, but did eat of the fruit\\nof the land of Canaan that year.\\n13 And when Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked: and\\nbehold, there stood a man against him, having a sword drawn in his hand: and\\nJoshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou on our side, or on our\\nadversaries?\\n14 And he said, Nay, but as a captain of the host of the Lord am I now come:\\nthen Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him,\\nWhat saith my Lord unto his servant?\\n15 And the captain of ye Lord’s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe of thy foot:\\nfor ye place whereon thou standest, is holy: and Joshua did so.\\nJoshua 6\\n1 Now Jericho was shut up, and closed, because of the children of Israel: none\\nmight go out nor enter in.\\n2 And the Lord said unto Joshua, Behold, I have given into thine hand Jericho\\nand the King thereof, and the strong men of war.\\n3 All ye therefore that be men of war, shall compass the city, in going round\\nabout the city once: thus shall you do six days:\\n4 And seven Priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the Ark:\\nand the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the Priests shall\\nblow with the trumpets.\\n5 And when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and ye hear the sound of\\nthe trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout: then shall the wall of\\nthe city fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up, every man straight before\\nhim.\\n6 Then, Joshua the son of Nun called the Priests and said unto them, Take up\\nthe Ark of the covenant, and let seven Priests bear seven trumpets of rams’\\nhorns before the Ark of the Lord.\\n7 But he said unto the people, Go and compass the city: and let him that is\\narmed, go forth before the Ark of the Lord.\\n8 And when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven Priests bare the\\nseven trumpets of rams’ horns, and went forth before the Ark of the Lord, and\\nblew with the trumpets, and the Ark of the covenant of ye Lord followed them.\\n9 And the men of arms went before the Priests, that blew the trumpets: then the\\ngathering host came after the Ark, as they went and blew the trumpets.\\n10 (Now Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall nor shout, neither\\nmake any noise with your voice, neither shall a word proceed out of your mouth,\\nuntil the day that I say unto you, Shout, then shall ye shout)\\n11 So the Ark of the Lord compassed the city, and went about it once: then they\\nreturned into the host, and lodged in the camp.\\n12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the Priests bare the Ark of the\\nLord:\\n13 Also seven Priests bare seven trumpets of rams’ horns, and went before the\\nArk of the Lord, and going blew with the trumpets: and the men of arms went\\nbefore them, but the gathering host came after the Ark of the Lord, as they went\\nand blew the trumpets.\\n14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the host:\\nthus they did six days.\\n15 And when the seventh day came, they rose early, even with the dawning of\\nthe day, and compassed the city after ye same manner seven times: only that\\nday they compassed the city seven times.\\n16 And when the Priests had blown ye trumpets the seventh time, Joshua said\\nunto ye people, Shout: for the Lord hath given you the city.\\n17 And the city shall be an execrable thing, both it, and all that are therein, unto\\nthe Lord: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she, and all that are with her in the\\nhouse: for she hid the messengers that we sent.\\n18 Notwithstanding, be ye ware of the execrable thing, lest ye make yourselves\\nexecrable, and in taking of the execrable thing, make also the host of Israel\\nexecrable, and trouble it.\\n19 But all silver, and gold, and vessels of brass, and iron shall be consecrated\\nunto the Lord, and shall come into the Lord’s treasury.\\n20 So the people shouted, when they had blown trumpets: for when the people\\nhad heard the sound of the trumpet, they shouted with a great shout: and the wall\\nfell down flat: so the people went up into the city, every man straight before him:\\nand they took the city.\\n21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman,\\nyoung, and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.\\n22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into\\nthe harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye\\nsware to her.\\n23 So the young men that were spies, went in, and brought out Rahab, and her\\nfather, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had: also they brought\\nout all her family, and put them without the host of Israel.\\n24 After they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver and\\nthe gold, and the vessels of brass and iron, they put unto the treasure of the\\nhouse of the Lord.\\n25 So Joshua saved Rahab the harlot, and her father’s household, and all that\\nshe had; and she dwelt in Israel even unto this day, because she had hid the\\nmessengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.\\n26 And Joshua sware at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before ye Lord,\\nthat riseth up, and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in\\nhis eldest son, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.\\n27 So the Lord was with Joshua, and he was famous through all the world.\\nJoshua 7\\n1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the excommunicated thing:\\nfor Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah of the tribe of\\nJudah took of the excommunicated thing: wherefore the wrath of the Lord was\\nkindled against the children of Israel.\\n2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on ye East\\nside of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up, and view the country. And\\nye men went up, and viewed Ai,\\n3 And returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up, but let\\nas it were two or three thousand men go up, and smite Ai, and make not all the\\npeople to labor thither, for they are few.\\n4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men, and they fled\\nbefore the men of Ai.\\n5 And the men of Ai smote of them upon a thirty and six men: for they chased\\nthem from before the gate unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down:\\nwherefore the hearts of the people melted away like water.\\n6 Then Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the Ark\\nof the Lord, until the eventide, he, and the Elders of Israel, and put dust upon\\ntheir heads.\\n7 And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou brought this people\\nover Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, and to destroy us?\\nWould God we had been content to dwell on the other side Jordan.\\n8 Oh Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turn their backs before their enemies?\\n9 For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall\\ncompass us, and destroy our name out of the earth: and what wilt thou do unto\\nthy mighty Name?\\n10 And the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up: wherefore liest thou thus upon\\nthy face?\\n11 Israel hath sinned, and they have transgressed my covenant, which I\\ncommanded them: for they have even taken of the excommunicated thing, and\\nhave also stolen, and dissembled also, and have put it even with their own stuff.\\n12 Therefore ye children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, but have\\nturned their backs before their enemies, because they be execrable: neither will I\\nbe with you any more, except ye destroy the excommunicated from among you.\\n13 Up therefore, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against\\ntomorrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an execrable thing\\namong you, O Israel, therefore ye cannot stand against your enemies, until ye\\nhave put the execrable thing from among you.\\n14 In the morning therefore ye shall come according to your tribes, and the tribe\\nwhich the Lord taketh, shall come according to the families: and the family which\\nthe Lord shall take, shall come by the households: and the household which the\\nLord shall take, shall come man by man.\\n15 And he that is taken with the excommunicated thing, shall be burnt with fire,\\nhe, and all that he hath, because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord,\\nand because he hath wrought folly in Israel.\\n16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes: and\\nthe tribe of Judah was taken.\\n17 And he brought the families of Judah, and took the family of the Zarhites, and\\nhe brought the family of the Zarhites, man by man, and Zabdi was taken.\\n18 And he brought his household, man by man, and Achan ye son of Carmi, the\\nson of Zabdi, the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was taken.\\n19 Then Joshua said unto Achan, My son, I beseech thee, give glory to the Lord\\nGod of Israel, and make confession unto him, and shew me now what thou hast\\ndone: hide it not from me.\\n20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed, I have sinned against the\\nLord God of Israel, and thus, and thus have I done.\\n21 I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels\\nof silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, and I coveted them, and\\ntook them: and behold, they lie hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the\\nsilver under it.\\n22 Then Joshua sent messengers, which ran unto the tent, and behold, it was hid\\nin his tent, and the silver under it.\\n23 Therefore they took them out of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and\\nunto all the children of Israel, and laid them before the Lord.\\n24 Then Joshua took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment\\nand the wedge of gold and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his\\nasses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and all Israel with him\\nbrought them unto the valley of Achor.\\n25 And Joshua said, In as much as thou hast troubled us, the Lord shall trouble\\nthee this day: and all Israel threw stones at him, and burned them with fire, and\\nstoned them with stones.\\n26 And they cast upon him a great heap of stones unto this day: and so the Lord\\nturned from his fierce wrath: therefore he called the name of that place, The\\nvalley of Achor, unto this day.\\nJoshua 8\\n1 After, the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou faint hearted: take\\nall the men of war with thee and arise, go up to Ai: behold, I have given into thine\\nhand the King of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.\\n2 And thou shalt do to Ai and to the King thereof, as thou didst unto Jericho and\\nto the King thereof: nevertheless the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye\\ntake unto you for a prey: thou shalt lie in wait against the city on the backside\\nthereof.\\n3 Then Joshua arose, and all the men of war to go up against Ai: and Joshua\\nchose out thirty thousand strong men, and valiant, and sent them away by night.\\n4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city\\non the backside of the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all in a\\nreadiness.\\n5 And I and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and when\\nthey shall come out against us, as they did at the first time, then will we flee\\nbefore them.\\n6 For they will come out after us, till we have brought them out of the city: for they\\nwill say, They flee before us as at the first time: so we will flee before them.\\n7 Then you shall rise up from lying in wait and destroy the city: for the Lord your\\nGod will deliver it into your hand.\\n8 And when ye have taken the city, ye shall set it on fire: according to the\\ncommandment of the Lord shall ye do: behold, I have charged you.\\n9 Joshua then sent them forth, and they went to lie in wait, and abode between\\nBeth-el and Ai, on the Westside of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the\\npeople.\\n10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people: and he\\nand the Elders of Israel went up before the people against Ai.\\n11 Also all the men of war that were with him went up and drew near, and came\\nagainst the city, and pitched on the Northside of Ai: and there was a valley\\nbetween them and Ai.\\n12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in wait between\\nBeth-el and Ai, on the Westside of the city.\\n13 And the people set all the host that was on the Northside against the city, and\\nthe liers in wait on the West, against the city: and Joshua went the same night\\ninto the midst of the valley.\\n14 And when the King of Ai saw it, then the men of the city hasted and rose up\\nearly, and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people at the time\\nappointed, before the plain: for he knew not that any lay in wait against him on\\nthe backside of the city.\\n15 Then Joshua and all Israel as beaten before them, fled by the way of the\\nwilderness.\\n16 And all the people of the city were called together, to pursue after them: and\\nthey pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away out of the city,\\n17 So that there was not a man left in Ai, nor in Beth-el, that went not out after\\nIsrael: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.\\n18 Then the Lord said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thine hand,\\ntoward Ai: for I will give it into thine hand: and Joshua stretched out the spear\\nthat he had in his hand, toward the city.\\n19 And they that lay in wait, arose quickly out of their place, and ran as soon as\\nhe had stretched out his hand, and they entered into the city, and took it, and\\nhasted, and set the city on fire.\\n20 And the men of Ai looked behind them, and saw it: for lo, the smoke of the city\\nascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: for\\nthe people that fled to the wilderness, turned back upon the pursuers.\\n21 When Joshua and all Israel saw that they that lay in wait, had taken the city,\\nand that the smoke of the city mounted up, then they turned again and slew the\\nmen of Ai.\\n22 Also the others issued out of the city against them: so were they in the midst\\nof Israel, these being on the one side, and the rest on the other side: and they\\nslew them, so that they let none of them remain nor escape.\\n23 And the King of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.\\n24 And when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the\\nfield, that is, in the wilderness, where they chased them, and when they were all\\nfallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, all the Israelites\\nreturned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.\\n25 And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even\\nall the men of Ai.\\n26 For Joshua drew not his hand back again which he had stretched out with the\\nspear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.\\n27 Only the cattle and the spoil of this city, Israel took for a prey unto themselves,\\naccording unto the word of the Lord, which he commanded Joshua.\\n28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap forever, and a wilderness unto this\\nday.\\n29 And the King of Ai he hanged on a tree, unto the evening. And as soon as the\\nsun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from\\nthe tree, and cast it at the entering of ye gate of the city, and lay thereon a great\\nheap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.\\n30 Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel, in mount Ebal,\\n31 As Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the children of Israel, as it\\nis written in the book of the Law of Moses, an altar of whole stone, over which no\\nman had lifted an iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord,\\nand sacrificed peace offerings.\\n32 Also he wrote there upon the stones, a rehearsal of the Law of Moses, which\\nhe wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.\\n33 And all Israel (and their Elders, and officers and their judges stood on this side\\nof the Ark, and on that side, before the Priests of the Levites, which bare the Ark\\nof the covenant of the Lord) as well the stranger, as he that is born in the country:\\nhalf of them were over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against\\nmount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before, that they\\nshould bless the people of Israel.\\n34 Then afterward he read all the words of the Law, the blessings and cursings,\\naccording to all that is written in the book of the Law.\\n35 There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded, which Joshua read\\nnot before all the Congregation of Israel, as well before the women and the\\nchildren, as the stranger that was conversant among them.\\nJoshua 9\\n1 And when all the Kings that were beyond Jordan, in the mountains and in the\\nvalleys, and by all the coasts of the great Sea over against Lebanon (as the\\nHittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the\\nJebusites) heard thereof,\\n2 They gathered themselves together, to fight against Joshua, and against Israel\\nwith one accord.\\n3 But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho, and to\\nAi.\\n4 And therefore they wrought craftily: for they went, and feigned themselves\\nambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and old bottles for wine, both\\nrent and bound up,\\n5 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet: also the raiment upon them was old,\\nand all their provision of bread was dried, and molded.\\n6 So they came unto Joshua into the host to Gilgal, and said unto him, and unto\\nthe men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make a league\\nwith us.\\n7 Then the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, It may be that thou dwellest\\namong us, how then can I make a league with thee?\\n8 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. Then Joshua said unto them,\\nWho are ye? And whence come ye?\\n9 And they answered him, From a very far country thy servants are come for the\\nName of the Lord thy God: for we have heard his fame and all that he hath done\\nin Egypt,\\n10 And all that he hath done to the two Kings of the Amorites that were beyond\\nJordan, to Sihon King of Heshbon, and to Og King of Bashan, which were at\\nAshtaroth.\\n11 Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us,\\nsaying, Take vitailles with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto\\nthem, We are your servants: now therefore make ye a league with us.\\n12 This our bread we took it hot with us for vitailles out of our houses, the day we\\ndeparted to come unto you: but now behold, it is dried, and it is molded.\\n13 Also these bottles of wine which we filled, were new, and lo, they be rent, and\\nthese our garments and our shoes are old, by reason of the exceeding great\\njourney.\\n14 And the men accepted their tale concerning their vitailles, and counseled not\\nwith the mouth of the Lord.\\n15 So Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, that he\\nwould suffer them to live: also the Princes of the Congregation sware unto them.\\n16 But at the end of three days, after they had made a league with them, they\\nheard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.\\n17 And the children of Israel took their journey, and came unto their cities the\\nthird day, and their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beroth and Kirjathjearim.\\n18 And the children of Israel slew them not, because the Princes of the\\nCongregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel: wherefore all the\\nCongregation murmured against the Princes.\\n19 Then all the Princes said unto all the Congregation, We have sworn unto them\\nby the Lord God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.\\n20 But this we will do to them, and let them live, lest the wrath be upon us\\nbecause of the oath which we sware unto them.\\n21 And the Princes said unto them again, Let them live, but they shall hew wood,\\nand draw water unto all the Congregation, as the Princes appoint them.\\n22 Joshua then called them, and talked with them, and said, Wherefore have ye\\nbeguiled us, saying, We are very far from you, when ye dwell among us?\\n23 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being\\nbondmen, and hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the house of my God.\\n24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was told thy servants, that\\nthe Lord thy God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and\\nto destroy all the inhabitants of the land out of your sight, therefore we were\\nexceeding sore afraid for our lives at the presence of you, and have done this\\nthing:\\n25 And behold now, we are in thine hand: do as it seemeth good and right in\\nthine eyes to do unto us.\\n26 Even so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children\\nof Israel, that they slew them not.\\n27 And Joshua appointed them that same day to be hewers of wood, and\\ndrawers of water for the Congregation, and for the altar of the Lord unto this day,\\nin the place which he should choose.\\nJoshua 10\\n1 Now when Adoni-zedek King of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai\\nand had destroyed it, (for as he had done to Jericho and to the King thereof, so\\nhe had done to Ai and to the King thereof) and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had\\nmade peace with Israel, and were among them,\\n2 Then they feared exceedingly: for Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal\\ncities: for it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.\\n3 Wherefore Adoni-zedek King of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham King of Hebron,\\nand unto Piram King of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia King of Lachish, and unto Debir\\nKing of Eglon, saying,\\n4 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for they have\\nmade peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.\\n5 Therefore the five Kings of the Amorites, the King of Jerusalem, the King of\\nHebron, the King of Jarmuth, the King of Lachish, and the King of Eglon gathered\\nthemselves together, and went up, they with all their hosts, and besieged\\nGibeon, and made war against it.\\n6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua, even to the host to Gilgal, saying,\\nWithdraw not thine hand from thy servants: come up to us quickly, and save us,\\nand help us: for all the Kings of the Amorites which dwell in the mountains, are\\ngathered together against us.\\n7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all\\nthe men of might.\\n8 And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have given them into thine\\nhand: none of them shall stand against thee.\\n9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly: for he went up from Gilgal all the\\nnight.\\n10 And the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great\\nslaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah and to Makkedah.\\n11 And as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon,\\nthe Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them, until Azekah, and they\\ndied: they were more that died with the hailstones, than they whom the children\\nof Israel slew with the sword.\\n12 Then spake Joshua to the Lord, in the day when the Lord gave the Amorites\\nbefore the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stay thou in\\nGibeon, and thou moon, in the valley of Ajalon.\\n13 And the Sun abode, and the moon stood still, until the people avenged\\nthemselves upon their enemies: (Is not this written in the book of Jasher?) so the\\nSun abode in the midst of the heaven, and hasted not to go down for a whole\\nday.\\n14 And there was no day like that before it, nor after it, that the Lord heard the\\nvoice of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel.\\n15 After, Joshua returned, and all Israel with him unto the camp to Gilgal:\\n16 But the five Kings fled and were hid in a cave at Makkedah.\\n17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five Kings are found hid in a cave at\\nMakkedah.\\n18 Then Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men\\nby it for to keep them.\\n19 But stand ye not still: follow after your enemies, and smite all the hindmost,\\nsuffer them not to enter into their cities: for the Lord your God hath given them\\ninto your hand.\\n20 And when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them\\nwith an exceeding great slaughter till they were consumed, and the rest that\\nremained of them were entered into walled cities,\\n21 Then all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: no\\nman moved his tongue against the children of Israel.\\n22 After, Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out these five Kings\\nunto me forth of the cave.\\n23 And they did so, and brought out those five Kings unto him forth of the cave,\\neven the King of Jerusalem, the King of Hebron, ye King of Jarmuth, the King of\\nLachish, and the King of Eglon.\\n24 And when they had brought out those Kings unto Joshua, Joshua called for all\\nthe men of Israel, and said unto the chief of the men of war, which went with him,\\nCome near, set your feet upon the necks of these Kings: and they came near\\nand set their feet upon their necks.\\n25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be faint hearted, but be strong and\\nof a good courage: for thus will the Lord do to all your enemies, against whom ye\\nfight.\\n26 So then Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees,\\nand they hanged still upon the trees until the evening.\\n27 And at the going down of the sun, Joshua gave commandment, that they\\nshould take them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave (wherein they\\nhad been hid) and they laid great stones upon the caves mouth, which remain\\nuntil this day.\\n28 And that same day Joshua took Makkedah and smote it with the edge of the\\nsword, and the King thereof destroyed he with them, and all the souls that were\\ntherein, he let none remain: for he did to the King of Makkedah as he had done\\nunto the King of Jericho.\\n29 Then Joshua went from Makkedah, and all Israel with him unto Libnah, and\\nfought against Libnah.\\n30 And the Lord gave it also and the King thereof into the hand of Israel: and he\\nsmote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein: he let\\nnone remain in it: for he did unto the King thereof, as he had done unto the King\\nof Jericho.\\n31 And Joshua departed from Libnah, and all Israel with him unto Lachish, and\\nbesieged it, and assaulted it.\\n32 And the Lord gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it the second\\nday, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein,\\naccording to all as he had done to Libnah.\\n33 Then Horam King of Gezer came up to help Lachish: but Joshua smote him\\nand his people, until none of his remained.\\n34 And from Lachish Joshua departed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him, and\\nthey besieged it, and assaulted it,\\n35 And they took it the same day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all\\nthe souls that were therein he utterly destroyed the same day, according to all\\nthat he had done to Lachish.\\n36 Then Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him unto Hebron, and\\nthey fought against it.\\n37 And when they had taken it, they smote it with the edge of the sword, and the\\nKing thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein: he left\\nnone remaining, according to all as he had done to Eglon: for he destroyed it\\nutterly, and all the souls that were therein.\\n38 So Joshua returned, and all Israel with him to Debir, and fought against it.\\n39 And when he had taken it, and the King thereof, and all the city thereof, they\\nsmote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that\\nwere therein, he let none remain: as he did to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to\\nthe King thereof, as he had also done to Libnah, and to the King thereof.\\n40 So Joshua smote all the hill countries, and the South countries, and the\\nvalleys, and the hill sides, and all their Kings, and let none remain, but utterly\\ndestroyed every soul, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded.\\n41 And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Azzah, and all the\\ncountry of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.\\n42 And all these Kings, and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the\\nLord God of Israel fought for Israel.\\n43 Afterward, Joshua and all Israel with him returned unto the camp in Gilgal.\\nJoshua 11\\n1 And when Jabin King of Hazor had heard this, then he sent to Jobab King of\\nMadon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,\\n2 And unto the Kings that were by ye North in the mountains and plains toward\\nthe Southside of Cinneroth, and in the valleys, and in the borders of Dor\\nWestward,\\n3 And unto the Canaanites, both by East, and by West, and unto the Amorites,\\nand Hittites, and Perizzites, and Jebusites in the mountains, and unto the Hivites\\nunder Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.\\n4 And they came out and all their hosts with them, many people as the sand that\\nis on the sea shore for multitude, with horses and chariots exceeding many.\\n5 So all these Kings met together, and came and pitched together at the waters\\nof Merom, for to fight against Israel.\\n6 Then the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid for them: for tomorrow about this\\ntime will I deliver them all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and\\nburn their chariots with fire.\\n7 Then came Joshua and all the men of war with him against them by the waters\\nof Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.\\n8 And the Lord gave them into the hand of Israel: and they smote them, and\\nchased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of\\nMizpeh Eastward, and smote them until they had none remaining of them.\\n9 And Joshua did unto them as the Lord bade him: he houghed their horses, and\\nburned their chariots with fire.\\n10 At that time also Joshua turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the King\\nthereof with the sword: for Hazor before time was the head of all those kingdoms.\\n11 Moreover, they smote all the persons that were therein with the edge of the\\nsword, utterly destroying all, leaving none alive, and he burned Hazor with fire.\\n12 So all ye cities of those Kings, and all the kings of them did Joshua take, and\\nsmote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them, as Moses\\nthe servant of the Lord had commanded.\\n13 But Israel burned none of the cities that stood still in their strength, save Hazor\\nonly, that Joshua burned.\\n14 And all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the children of Israel took for\\ntheir prey, but they smote every man with the edge of the sword until they had\\ndestroyed them, not leaving one alive.\\n15 As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command\\nJoshua, and so did Joshua: he left nothing undone of all that the Lord had\\ncommanded Moses.\\n16 So Joshua took all this land of the mountains, and all the South, and all the\\nland of Goshen, and the low country, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel,\\nand the low country of the same,\\n17 From the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley\\nof Lebanon, under mount Hermon: and all their Kings he took, and smote them,\\nand slew them.\\n18 Joshua made war long time with all those Kings,\\n19 Neither was there any city that made peace with the children of Israel, save\\nthose Hivites that inhabited Gibeon: all others they took by battle.\\n20 For it came of the Lord, to harden their hearts that they should come against\\nIsrael in battle to the intent that they should destroy them utterly, and shew them\\nno mercy, but that they should bring them to nought: as the Lord had\\ncommanded Moses.\\n21 And that same season came Joshua, and destroyed the Anakims out of the\\nmountains: as out of Hebron, out of Debir, out of Anab, and out of all the\\nmountains of Judah, and out of all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed\\nthem utterly with their cities.\\n22 There was no Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Azzah, in\\nGath, and in Ashdod were they left.\\n23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord had said unto\\nMoses: and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their\\nportion through their tribes: then the land was at rest without war.\\nJoshua 12\\n1 And these are the Kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote and\\npossessed their land, on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from\\nthe river Arnon, unto mount Hermon, and all the plain Eastward.\\n2 Sihon King of the Amorites, that dwelt in Heshbon, having dominion from Aroer,\\nwhich is beside the river of Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half\\nGilead unto the river Jabbok, in the border of the children of Ammon.\\n3 And from the plain unto the sea of Cinneroth Eastward, and unto the Sea of the\\nplain, even the salt sea Eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth, and from the South\\nunder the springs of Pisgah.\\n4 They conquered also the coast of Og King of Bashan of the remnant of the\\ngiants, which dwelt at Ashtaroth, and at Edrei,\\n5 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the\\nborder of the Geshurites, and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, even the border\\nof Sihon King of Heshbon.\\n6 Moses the servant of the Lord, and the children of Israel smote them: Moses\\nalso the servant of the Lord gave their land for a possession unto the\\nReubenites, and unto the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh.\\n7 These also are the Kings of the country, which Joshua and the children of\\nIsrael smote on this side Jordan, Westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of\\nLebanon, even unto the mount Halak that goeth up to Seir, and Joshua gave it\\nunto the tribes of Israel for a possession, according to their portions:\\n8 In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the hill sides, and\\nin the wilderness, and in the South, where were the Hittites, the Amorites, and\\nthe Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.\\n9 The King of Jericho was one: the King of Ai, which is beside Beth-el, one:\\n10 The King of Jerusalem, one: the King of Hebron, one:\\n11 The King of Jarmuth, one: the King of Lachish, one:\\n12 The King of Eglon, one: the King of Gezer, one:\\n13 The King of Debir, one: the King of Geder, one:\\n14 The King of Hormah, one: the King of Arad, one:\\n15 The King of Libnah, one: the King of Adullam, one:\\n16 The King of Makkedah, one: the King of Beth-el, one:\\n17 The King of Tappuah, one: the King of Hepher, one:\\n18 The King of Aphek, one: the King of Lasharon, one:\\n19 The King of Madon, one: the King of Hazor, one:\\n20 The king of Shimron-meron, one: the King of Achshaph, one:\\n21 The King of Taanach, one: the King of Megiddo, one:\\n22 The King of Kedesh, one: the King of Jokneam of Carmel, one:\\n23 The King of Dor, in the country of Dor, one: the King of the nations of Gilgal,\\none:\\n24 The King of Tirzah, one. all the Kings were thirty and one.\\nJoshua 13\\n1 Now when Joshua was old, and stricken in years, the Lord said unto him, Thou\\nart old and grown in age, and there remaineth exceeding much land to be\\npossessed:\\n2 This is the land that remaineth, all the regions of the Philistines, and all\\nGeshuri,\\n3 From Nilus which is in Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron Northward: this is\\ncounted of the Canaanites, even five Lordships of the Philistines, the Azzitites,\\nand the Ashdodites, the Eshkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites, and the\\nAvites:\\n4 From the South, all the land of the Canaanites, and the cave that is beside the\\nSidonians, unto Aphek, and to the borders of the Amorites:\\n5 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sun rising from Baalgad under mount Hermon, until one come to Hamath.\\n6 All the inhabitants of the mountains from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, and\\nall the Sidonians, I will cast them out from before the children of Israel: only\\ndivide thou it by lot unto the Israelites, to inherit, as I have commanded thee.\\n7 Now therefore divide this land to inherit, unto the nine tribes, and to the half\\ntribe of Manasseh.\\n8 For with half thereof the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their\\ninheritance, which Moses gave them beyond Jordan Eastward, even as Moses\\nthe servant of the Lord had given them,\\n9 From Aroer that is on the brink of the river Arnon, and from the city that is in the\\nmidst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon,\\n10 And all the cities of Sihon King of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon,\\nunto the borders of the children of Ammon,\\n11 And Gilead, and the borders of the Geshurites and of the Maachathites, and\\nall mount Hermon, with all Bashan unto Salcah:\\n12 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei:\\n(who remained of the rest of the giants) for these did Moses smite, and cast them\\nout.\\n13 But the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites nor the Maachathites:\\nbut the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites even unto\\nthis day.\\n14 Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance, but the sacrifices of the\\nLord God of Israel are his inheritance, as he said unto him.\\n15 Moses then gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance,\\naccording to their families.\\n16 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the brink of the river Arnon, and\\nfrom the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain which is by Medeba:\\n17 Heshbon with all the cities thereof, that are in the plain: Dibon and Bamothbaal, and Beth-baal-meon:\\n18 And Jahazah, and Kedemoth and Mephaath:\\n19 Kirjathaim also, and Sibmah, and Zerethshahar in the mount of Emek:\\n20 And Beth-peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth:\\n21 And all the cities of the plain: and all the kingdom of Sihon King of the\\nAmorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the Princes of\\nMidian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the dukes of Sihon,\\ndwelling in the country.\\n22 And Balaam the son of Beor the soothsayer did the children of Israel slay with\\nthe sword, among them that were slain.\\n23 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan with the coasts. This\\nwas the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, with the\\ncities and their villages.\\n24 Also Moses gave inheritance unto ye tribe of Gad, even unto the children of\\nGad according to their families.\\n25 And their coasts were Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead and half the land of\\nthe children of Ammon unto Aroer, which is before Rabbah:\\n26 And from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim: and from Mahanaim\\nunto the borders of Debir:\\n27 And in the valley Beth-aram, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the\\nrest of the kingdom of Sihon King of Heshbon, unto Jordan and the borders even\\nunto the Sea coast of Cinneereth, beyond Jordan Eastward.\\n28 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad, after their families, with the\\ncities, and their villages.\\n29 Also Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this\\nbelonged to the half tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families.\\n30 And their border was from Mahanaim, even all Bashan, to wit, all the kingdom\\nof Og King of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan, threescore\\ncities,\\n31 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in\\nBashan, were given unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, to half of\\nthe children of Machir after their families.\\n32 These are the heritages, which Moses did distribute in the plain of Moab\\nbeyond Jordan, toward Jericho Eastward.\\n33 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave none inheritance: for the Lord God of\\nIsrael is their inheritance, as he said unto them.\\nJoshua 14\\n1 These also are the places which the children of Israel inherited in the land of\\nCanaan, which Eleazar the Priest, and Joshua the son of Nun and the chief\\nfathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed to them,\\n2 By the lot of their inheritance, as the Lord had commanded by the hand of\\nMoses, to give to the nine tribes, and the half tribe.\\n3 For Moses had given inheritance unto two tribes and an half tribe, beyond\\nJordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.\\n4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore\\nthey gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the\\nsuburbs of the same for their beasts and their substance.\\n5 As the Lord had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did when they\\ndivided the land.\\n6 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of\\nJephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest what the Lord said unto\\nMoses the man of God, concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea.\\n7 Forty years old was I, when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from\\nKadesh-barnea to espy the land, and I brought him word again, as I thought in\\nmine heart.\\n8 But my brethren that went up with me, discouraged the heart of the people: yet\\nI followed still the Lord my God.\\n9 Wherefore Moses sware the same day, saying, Certainly the land whereon thy\\nfeet have trodden, shall be thine inheritance, and thy children’s forever, because\\nthou hast followed constantly the Lord my God.\\n10 Therefore behold now, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he promised: this is the\\nforty and fifth year since the Lord spake this thing unto Moses, while the children\\nof Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now lo, I am this day four score and\\nfive years old:\\n11 And yet am as strong at this time, as I was when Moses sent me: as strong as\\nI was then, so strong am I now, either for war, or for government.\\n12 Now therefore give me this mountain whereof ye Lord spake in that day (for\\nthou heardest in that day, how the Anakims were there, and the cities great and\\nwalled) if so be the Lord will be with me, that I may drive them out, as the Lord\\nsaid.\\n13 Then Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh,\\nHebron for an inheritance.\\n14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the\\nKenezite, unto this day: because he followed constantly the Lord God of Israel.\\n15 And the name of Hebron was before time, Kirjath-arba: which Arba was a\\ngreat man among the Anakims: thus the land ceased from war.\\nJoshua 15\\n1 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families: even\\nto the border of Edom and the wilderness of Zin, Southward on the Southcoast.\\n2 And their South border was the salt Sea coast, from the point that looketh\\nSouthward.\\n3 And it went out on the Southside toward Maaleh-acrabbim, and went along to\\nZin, and ascended up on the Southside unto Kadesh-barnea, and went along to\\nHezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa.\\n4 From thence went it along to Azmon, and reached unto the river of Egypt, and\\nthe end of that coast was on the Westside: this shall be your South coast.\\n5 Also the East border shall be the salt Sea, unto the end of Jordan: and the\\nborder on the North quarter from the point of the Sea, and from the end of\\nJordan.\\n6 And this border goeth up to Beth-hoglah, and goeth along by ye Northside of\\nBeth-arabah: so the border from thence goeth up to the stone of Bohan the son\\nof Reuben.\\n7 Again this border goeth up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and Northward,\\nturning toward Gilgal, that lieth before the going up to Adummim, which is on the\\nSouthside of the river: also this border goeth up to the waters of En-shemesh,\\nand endeth at En-rogel.\\n8 Then this border goeth up to the valley of the son of Hinnom; on the Southside\\nof the Jebusites: the same is Jerusalem. also this border goeth up to the top of\\nthe mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom Westward, which is by the\\nend of the valley of ye giants Northward.\\n9 So this border compasseth from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of\\nthe water of Nephtoah, and goeth out to the cities of mount Ephron: and this\\nborder draweth to Baalah, which is Kirjath-jearim.\\n10 Then this border compasseth from Baalah Westward unto mount Seir, and\\ngoeth along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon on the Northside:\\nso it cometh down to Bethshemesh, and goeth to Timnah.\\n11 Also this border goeth out unto the side of Ekron Northward: and this border\\ndraweth to Shicron, and goeth along to mount Baalah, and stretcheth unto\\nJabneel: and the ends of this coast are to the Sea.\\n12 And the West border is to the great Sea: so this border shall be the bounds of\\nthe children of Judah round about, according to their families.\\n13 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh did Joshua give a part among the\\nchildren of Judah, as the Lord commanded him, even Kirjath-arba of the father of\\nAnak, which is Hebron.\\n14 And Caleb drove thence three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and\\nTalmai, the sons of Anak.\\n15 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir\\nbefore time was Kirjath-sepher.\\n16 Then Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, even to him will\\nI give Achsah my daughter to wife.\\n17 And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb took it: and he gave him\\nAchsah his daughter to wife.\\n18 And as she went in to him, she moved him, to ask of her father a field: and she\\nlighted off her ass, and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?\\n19 Then she answered, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me the South\\ncountry: give me also springs of water. And he gave her the springs above and\\nthe springs beneath.\\n20 This shall be the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to\\ntheir families.\\n21 And the utmost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah, toward the coasts of\\nEdom Southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,\\n22 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,\\n23 And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,\\n24 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,\\n25 And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, Hezron (which is Hazor)\\n26 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,\\n27 And Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-palet,\\n28 And Hazar-shual, and Bersheba, and Bizjothjah,\\n29 Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,\\n30 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,\\n31 And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,\\n32 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all these cities are twenty\\nand nine with their villages.\\n33 In the low country were Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,\\n34 And Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,\\n35 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,\\n36 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim: fourteen cities\\nwith their villages.\\n37 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal-gad,\\n38 And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Jokthel,\\n39 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,\\n40 And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,\\n41 And Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah: sixteen cities with\\ntheir villages.\\n42 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,\\n43 And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,\\n44 And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah: nine cities with their villages.\\n45 Ekron with her towns and her villages,\\n46 From Ekron, even unto the Sea, all that lieth about Ashdod with their villages.\\n47 Ashdod with her towns and her villages: Azzah with her towns and her\\nvillages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great Sea was their coast.\\n48 And in the mountains were Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,\\n49 And Dannah, and Kirjath-sannah (which is Debir)\\n50 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,\\n51 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh: eleven cities with their villages,\\n52 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,\\n53 And Janum, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah,\\n54 And Humtah, and Kirjath-arba, (which is Hebron) and Zior: nine cities with their\\nvillages.\\n55 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,\\n56 And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,\\n57 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah: ten cities with their villages.\\n58 Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor,\\n59 And Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon: six cities with their villages.\\n60 Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim, and Rabbah: two cities with their villages.\\n61 In the wilderness were Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,\\n62 And Nibshan, and the city of salt, and Engedi: six cities with their villages.\\n63 Nevertheless, the Jebusites that were the inhabitants of Jerusalem, could not\\nthe children of Judah cast out, but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah\\nat Jerusalem unto this day.\\nJoshua 16\\n1 And the lot fell to the children of Joseph from Jordan by Jericho unto the water\\nof Jericho Eastward, and to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho by the\\nmount Beth-el:\\n2 And goeth out from Beth-el to Luz, and runneth along unto the borders of\\nArchiataroth,\\n3 And goeth down Westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer: and the ends thereof are at the Sea.\\n4 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim took their inheritance.\\n5 Also the borders of the children of Ephraim according to their families, even the\\nborders of their inheritance on the Eastside were Atroth-addar, unto Beth-horon\\nthe upper.\\n6 And this border goeth out to the Sea unto Michmethah on the Northside, and\\nthis border returneth Eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passeth it on the\\nEastside unto Janohah,\\n7 And goeth down from Janohah to Ataroth, and Naarath, and cometh to Jericho,\\nand goeth out at Jordan.\\n8 And this border goeth from Tappuah Westward unto the river Kanah, and the\\nends thereof are at the Sea: this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of\\nEphraim by their families.\\n9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance\\nof the children of Manasseh: all the cities with their villages.\\n10 And they cast not out the Canaanite that dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanite\\ndwelt among the Ephraimites unto this day, and served under tribute.\\nJoshua 17\\n1 This was also the lot of the tribe of Manasseh: for he was the first born of\\nJoseph, to wit, of Machir the first born of Manasseh, and the father of Gilead:\\nnow because he was a man of war, he had Gilead and Bashan.\\n2 And also of the rest of the sons of Manasseh by their families, even of the sons\\nof Abiezer, and of the sons of Helek, and of ye sons of Asriel, and of the sons of\\nShechem, and of the sons of Hepher, and of the sons of Shemida: these were\\nthe males of Manasseh, the son of Joseph according to their families.\\n3 But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, ye son\\nof Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his\\ndaughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah:\\n4 Which came before Eleazar the Priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and\\nbefore the princes, saying, The Lord commanded Moses to give us an\\ninheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of the\\nLord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.\\n5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan,\\nwhich is on the other side Jordan,\\n6 Because the daughters of Manasseh did inherit among his sons: and\\nManasseh’s other sons had the land of Gilead.\\n7 So the borders of Manasseh were from Asher to Michmethah that lieth before\\nShechem, and this border goeth on the right hand, even unto the inhabitants of\\nEn-tappuah.\\n8 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah beside the border of\\nManasseh belongeth to the sons of Ephraim.\\n9 Also this border goeth down unto the river Kanah Southward to the river: these\\ncities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh\\nis on the Northside of the river, and the ends of it are at the Sea,\\n10 The South pertaineth to Ephraim, and the North to Manasseh, and the Sea is\\nhis border: and they met together in Asher Northward, and in Issachar Eastward.\\n11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher, Beth-shean, and her towns, and\\nIbleam, and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor with ye towns thereof, and the\\ninhabitants of En-dor with the towns thereof, and the inhabitants of Taanach with\\nher towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo with the towns of the same, even three\\ncountries.\\n12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not destroy those cities, but the\\nCanaanites dwelled still in that land.\\n13 Nevertheless, when the children of Israel were strong, they put the Canaanites\\nunder tribute, but cast them not out wholly.\\n14 Then the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given\\nme but one lot, and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, for as\\nmuch as the Lord hath blessed me hitherto?\\n15 Joshua then answered them, If thou be much people, get thee up to the\\nwoods, and cut trees for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites, and of the\\ngiants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.\\n16 Then the children of Joseph said, The mountain will not be enough for us: and\\nall the Canaanites that dwell in the low country have chariots of iron, as well they\\nin Beth-shean, and in the towns of the same, as they in the valley of Jezreel.\\n17 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, to Ephraim, and to Manasseh,\\nsaying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power, and shalt not have one\\nlot.\\n18 Therefore the mountain shall be thine: for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it\\ndown: and the ends of it shall be thine, and thou shalt cast out the Canaanites,\\nthough they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.\\nJoshua 18\\n1 And the whole Congregation of the children of Israel, came together at Shiloh:\\nfor they set up the Tabernacle of the Congregation there, after the land was\\nsubject unto them.\\n2 Now there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, to whom they\\nhad not divided their inheritance.\\n3 Therefore Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye so slack to\\nenter and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers hath given you?\\n4 Give from among you for every tribe three men, that I may send them, and that\\nthey may rise, and walk through the land, and distribute it according to their\\ninheritance, and return to me.\\n5 And that they may divide it unto them into seven parts, (Judah shall abide in his\\ncoast at the South, and the house of Joseph shall stand in their coasts at the\\nNorth)\\n6 Ye shall describe the land therefore into seven parts, and shall bring them\\nhither to me, and I will cast lots for you here before the Lord our God.\\n7 But the Levites shall have no part among you: for the Priesthood of the Lord is\\ntheir inheritance: also Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have\\nreceived their inheritance beyond Jordan Eastward, which Moses the servant of\\nthe Lord gave them.\\n8 Then the men arose, and went their way: and Joshua charged them that went\\nto describe the land, saying, Depart, and go through the land, and describe it,\\nand return to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the Lord in Shiloh.\\n9 So the men departed, and passed through the land, and described it by cities\\ninto seven parts in a book, and returned to Joshua into the camp at Shiloh.\\n10 Then Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord, and there Joshua\\ndivided the land unto the children of Israel, according to their portions:\\n11 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came forth according to\\ntheir families, and the cost of their lot lay between the children of Judah, and the\\nchildren of Joseph.\\n12 And their coast on the Northside was from Jordan, and the border went up to\\nthe side of Jericho on the North part, and went up through the mountains\\nWestward, and the ends thereof are in the wilderness of Beth-aven:\\n13 And this border goeth along from thence to Luz, even to the Southside of Luz\\n(the same is Beth-el) and this border descendeth to Atroth-addar, near the\\nmount, that lieth on the Southside of Beth-horon the nether.\\n14 So the border turneth, and compasseth the corner of the Sea Southward, from\\nthe mount that lieth before Beth-horon Southward: and the ends thereof are at\\nKirjath-baal (which is Kirjath-jearim) a city of the children of Judah: this is the\\nWest quarter.\\n15 And the South quarter is from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and this border goeth\\nout Westward, and cometh to the fountain of waters of Nephtoah.\\n16 And this border descendeth at the end of the mountain, that lieth before the\\nvalley of Ben-hinnom, which is in the valley of the giants Northward, and\\ndescendeth into the valley of Hinnom by the side of Jebusi Southward, and goeth\\ndown to En-rogel,\\n17 And compasseth from the North, and goeth forth to En-shemesh, and\\nstretcheth to Geliloth, which is toward the going up unto Adummim, and goeth\\ndown to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.\\n18 So it goeth along to the side over against the plain Northward, and goeth down\\ninto the plain.\\n19 After, this border goeth along to the side of Beth-hoglah Northward: and the\\nends thereof, that is, of the border, reach to the point of the salt Sea Northward,\\nand to the end of Jordan Southward: this is the Southcoast.\\n20 Also Jordan is the border of it on the Eastside: this is the inheritance of the\\nchildren of Benjamin by the coasts thereof round about according to their\\nfamilies.\\n21 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their\\nfamilies, are Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,\\n22 And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el,\\n23 And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,\\n24 And Chephar-haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba: twelve cities with their\\nvillages.\\n25 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beroth,\\n26 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,\\n27 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,\\n28 And Zela, Eleph, and Jebusi, (which is Jerusalem) Gibeath, and Kirjath:\\nfourteen cities with their villages: this is the inheritance of the children of\\nBenjamin according to their families.\\nJoshua 19\\n1 And the second lot came out to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of\\nSimeon according to their families: and their inheritance was in the midst of the\\ninheritance of the children of Judah.\\n2 Now they had in their inheritance, Bersheba, and Sheba, and Moladah,\\n3 And Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Azem,\\n4 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,\\n5 And Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah,\\n6 And Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen: thirteen cities with their villages.\\n7 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan: four cities with their villages.\\n8 And all the villages that were round about these cities, unto Baalath-beer, and\\nRamath Southward: this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon\\naccording to their families.\\n9 Out of the portion of the children of Judah came ye inheritance of the children\\nof Simeon: for the part of ye children of Judah was too much for them: therefore\\nthe children of Simeon had their inheritance within their inheritance.\\n10 Also the third lot arose for the children of Zebulun according to their families:\\nand the coasts of their inheritance came to Sarid,\\n11 And their border goeth up Westward, even to Maralah, and reacheth to\\nDabbasheth, and meeteth with the river that lieth before Jokneam,\\n12 And turneth from Sarid Eastward toward the sun rising unto the border of\\nChisloth-tabor, and goeth out to Daberath, and ascendeth to Japhia,\\n13 And from thence goeth along Eastward toward the sun rising to Gittah-hepher\\nto Ittah-kazin, and goeth forth to Rimmon, and turneth to Neah.\\n14 And this border compasseth it on ye Northside to Hannathon, and the ends\\nthereof are in the valley of Jiphtah-el,\\n15 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Beth-lehem: twelve\\ncities with their villages.\\n16 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families:\\nthat is, these cities and their villages.\\n17 The fourth lot came out to Issachar, even for the children of Issachar\\naccording to their families.\\n18 And their coast was Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,\\n19 And Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,\\n20 And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,\\n21 And Remeth, and En-gannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez.\\n22 And this coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimath, and Beth-shemesh, and\\nthe ends of their coast reach to Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.\\n23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their\\nfamilies: that is, the cities, and their villages.\\n24 Also the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to\\ntheir families.\\n25 And their coast was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,\\n26 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal, and came to Carmel Westward,\\nand to Shihor-libnath,\\n27 And turneth toward the sun rising to Beth-dagon, and cometh to Zebulun, and\\nto the valley of Jiphthah-el, toward the Northside of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and\\ngoeth out on the left side of Cabul,\\n28 And to Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, unto great Zidon.\\n29 Then the coast turneth to Ramah and to the strong city of Zor, and this border\\nturneth to Hosah, and the ends thereof are at the Sea from Hebel to Achzib,\\n30 Ummah also and Aphek, and Rehob: two and twenty cities with their villages.\\n31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their\\nfamilies: that is, these cities and their villages.\\n32 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even to the children of\\nNaphtali according to their families.\\n33 And their coast was from Heleph, and from Allon in Zaanannim, and\\nAdaminekeb, and Jabneel, even to Lakum, and the ends thereof are at Jordan.\\n34 So this coast turneth Westward to Aznoth-tabor, and goeth out from thence to\\nHukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the Southside, and goeth to Asher on the\\nWestside, and to Judah by Jordan toward the sun rising.\\n35 And the strong cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Cinnereth,\\n36 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,\\n37 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,\\n38 And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anah, and Beth-shemesh: nineteen\\ncities with their villages.\\n39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their\\nfamilies: that is, the cities and their villages.\\n40 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their\\nfamilies.\\n41 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh,\\n42 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,\\n43 And Elon, and Timnathah, and Ekron,\\n44 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,\\n45 And Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon,\\n46 And Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border that lieth before Japho.\\n47 But the coasts of the children of Dan fell out too little for them: therefore the\\nchildren of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with\\nthe edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem,\\nDan after the name of Dan their father.\\n48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their\\nfamilies: that is, these cities and their villages.\\n49 When they had made an end of dividing the land by the coasts thereof, then\\nthe children of Israel gave an inheritance unto Joshua the son of Nun among\\nthem.\\n50 According to the word of the Lord they gave him the city which he asked, even\\nTimnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city and dwelt therein.\\n51 These are ye heritages which Eleazar the Priest, and Joshua the son of Nun,\\nand the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel divided by lot in Shiloh\\nbefore the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation: so they made\\nan end of dividing the country.\\nJoshua 20\\n1 The Lord also spake unto Joshua, saying,\\n2 Speak to the children of Israel, and say, Appoint you cities of refuge, whereof I\\nspake unto you by the hand of Moses,\\n3 That the slayer that killeth any person by ignorance, and unwittingly, may flee\\nthither, and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.\\n4 And he that doeth flee unto one of those cities, shall stand at the entering of the\\ngate of the city, and shall shew his cause to the Elders of the city: and they shall\\nreceive him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell with\\nthem.\\n5 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, they shall not deliver the slayer\\ninto his hand because he smote his neighbor ignorantly, neither hated he him\\nbeforetime:\\n6 But he shall dwell in that city until he stands before the Congregation in\\njudgment, or until the death of the high Priest that shall be in those days: then\\nshall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house,\\neven unto the city from whence he fled.\\n7 Then they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in\\nmount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, (which is Hebron) in the mountain of Judah.\\n8 And on the other side Jordan toward Jericho Eastward, they appointed Bezer in\\nthe wilderness upon the plain, out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead,\\nout of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, out of the tribe of Manasseh.\\n9 These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the\\nstranger that sojourned among them, that whosoever killed any person\\nignorantly, might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood,\\nuntil he stood before the Congregation.\\nJoshua 21\\n1 Then came the principal fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the Priest, and\\nunto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the chief fathers of the tribes of the\\nchildren of Israel,\\n2 And spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The Lord\\ncommanded by the hand of Moses, to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs\\nthereof for our cattle.\\n3 So the children of Israel gave unto the Levites, out of their inheritance at the\\ncommandment of the Lord these cities with their suburbs.\\n4 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of\\nAaron ye Priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot, out of the tribe of Judah,\\nand out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin thirteen cities.\\n5 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe\\nof Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten\\ncities.\\n6 Also the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of\\nIssachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of ye tribe of Naphtali, and out of\\nthe half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.\\n7 The children of Merari according to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben,\\nand out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.\\n8 So the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their\\nsuburbs, as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses.\\n9 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of\\nthe children of Simeon, these cities which are here named.\\n10 And they were the children of Aaron being of the families of the Kohathites,\\nand of the sons of Levi, (for theirs was the first lot)\\n11 So they gave them Kirjath-arba of the father of Anak (which is Hebron) in the\\nmountain of Judah, with the suburbs of the same round about it.\\n12 (But the land of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of\\nJephunneh to be his possession)\\n13 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the Priest, a city of refuge for the\\nslayer, even Hebron with her suburbs, and Libnah with her suburbs,\\n14 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa, and her suburbs,\\n15 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,\\n16 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, Beth-shemesh with her\\nsuburbs: nine cities out of those two tribes.\\n17 And out of the tribe of Benjamin they gave Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba\\nwith her suburbs,\\n18 Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs: four cities.\\n19 All the cities of the children of Aaron Priests, were thirteen cities with their\\nsuburbs.\\n20 But to the families of the children of Kohath of the Levites, which were the rest\\nof the children of Kohath (for the cities of their lot were out of the tribe of\\nEphraim)\\n21 They gave them the city of refuge for the slayer, Shechem with her suburbs in\\nmount Ephraim, and Gezer with her suburbs,\\n22 And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Beth-horon with her suburbs: four cities.\\n23 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her\\nsuburbs,\\n24 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gath-rimmon with her suburbs: four cities.\\n25 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs: two cities.\\n26 All the cities for the other families of the children of Kohath were ten with their\\nsuburbs.\\n27 Also unto the children of Gershon of the families of the Levites, they gave out\\nof the half tribe of Manasseh, the city of refuge for the slayer, Golan in Bashan\\nwith her suburbs, and Beshterah with her suburbs: two cities.\\n28 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabereh with her\\nsuburbs,\\n29 Jarmuth with her suburbs, En-gannim with her suburbs: four cities.\\n30 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her\\nsuburbs,\\n31 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs: four cities.\\n32 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, the city of refuge for the slayer, Kedesh in\\nGalilee with her suburbs, and Hammoth-dor with her suburbs, and Kartan with\\nher suburbs: three cities.\\n33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families, were thirteen cities\\nwith their suburbs.\\n34 Also unto the families of the children of Merari the rest of the Levites, they\\ngave out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her\\nsuburbs,\\n35 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal, with her suburbs: four cities.\\n36 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her\\nsuburbs,\\n37 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs: four cities.\\n38 And out of the tribe of Gad they gave for a city of refuge for the slayer, Ramoth\\nin Gilead with her suburbs, and Mahanaim with her suburbs,\\n39 Heshbon with her suburbs, and Jazer with her suburbs: four cities in all.\\n40 So all the cities of the children of Merari according to their families (which were\\nthe rest of the families of the Levites) were by their lot, twelve cities.\\n41 And all the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel,\\nwere eight and forty with their suburbs.\\n42 These cities lay every one severally with their suburbs round about them: so\\nwere all these cities.\\n43 So the Lord gave unto Israel all ye land, which he had sworn to give unto their\\nfathers: and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.\\n44 Also the Lord gave them rest round about according to all that he had sworn\\nunto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them: for\\nthe Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand.\\n45 There failed nothing of all the good things, which the Lord hath said unto the\\nhouse of Israel, but all came to pass.\\nJoshua 22\\n1 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of\\nManasseh,\\n2 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord\\ncommanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:\\n3 You have not forsaken your brethren this long season unto this day, but have\\ndiligently kept the commandment of the Lord your God.\\n4 And now the Lord hath given rest unto your brethren as he promised them:\\ntherefore now return ye and go to your tents, to the land of your possession,\\nwhich Moses the servant of the Lord hath given you beyond Jordan.\\n5 But take diligent heed, to do the commandment and Law, which Moses the\\nservant of the Lord commanded you: that is, that ye love the Lord your God, and\\nwalk in all his ways, and keep his commandments, and cleave unto him, and\\nserve him with all your heart and with all your soul.\\n6 So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went unto their tents.\\n7 Now unto one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in\\nBashan: and unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on\\nthis side Jordan Westward: therefore when Joshua sent them away unto their\\ntents, and blessed them,\\n8 Thus he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and\\nwith a great multitude of cattle, with silver and with gold, with brass and with iron,\\nand with great abundance of raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your\\nbrethren.\\n9 So the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of\\nManasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel from Shiloh (which\\nis in the land of Canaan) to go unto the country of Gilead to the land of their\\npossession, which they had obtained, according to ye word of the Lord by the\\nhand of Moses.\\n10 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan (which are in the land of\\nCanaan) then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe\\nof Manasseh, built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.\\n11 When the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben, and the\\nchildren of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront\\nof the land of Canaan upon the borders of Jordan at the passage of the children\\nof Israel:\\n12 When the children of Israel heard it, then the whole Congregation of the\\nchildren of Israel gathered them together at Shiloh to go up to war against them.\\n13 Then the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the\\nchildren of Gad, and to ye half tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead,\\nPhinehas the son of Eleazar the Priest,\\n14 And with him ten princes, of every chief house a prince, according to all the\\ntribes of Israel: for every one was chief of their fathers household among the\\nthousands of Israel.\\n15 So they went unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to\\nthe half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and spake with them, saying,\\n16 Thus saith the whole congregation of the Lord, What transgression is this that\\nye have transgressed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from the\\nLord, in that ye have built you an altar for to rebel this day against the Lord?\\n17 Have we too little for the wickedness of Peor, whereof we are not cleansed\\nunto this day, though a plague came upon the Congregation of the Lord?\\n18 Ye also are turned away this day from the Lord: and seeing ye rebel today\\nagainst ye Lord, even tomorrow he will be wroth with all the Congregation of\\nIsrael.\\n19 Notwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean, come ye over unto\\nthe land of the possession of the Lord, wherein the Lord’s Tabernacle dwelleth,\\nand take possession among us: but rebel not against the Lord, nor rebel not\\nagainst us in building you an altar, beside the altar of the Lord our God.\\n20 Did not Achan ye son of Zerah trespass grievously in the execrable thing, and\\nwrath fell on all the Congregation of Israel? And this man alone perished not in\\nhis wickedness.\\n21 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of\\nManasseh answered, and said unto the heads over the thousands of Israel,\\n22 The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel himself\\nshall know: if by rebellion, or by transgression against ye Lord we have done it,\\nsave thou us not this day.\\n23 If we have built us an altar to return away from the Lord, either to offer thereon\\nburnt offering, or meat offering, or to offer peace offerings thereon, let the Lord\\nhimself require it:\\n24 And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come\\nyour children might say unto our children, What have ye to do with the Lord God\\nof Israel?\\n25 For the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of\\nReuben, and of Gad: therefore ye have no part in the Lord: so shall your children\\nmake our children cease from fearing the Lord.\\n26 Therefore we said, We will now go about to make us an altar, not for burnt\\noffering, nor for sacrifice,\\n27 But it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations\\nafter us, to execute the service of the Lord before him in our burnt offerings, and\\nin our sacrifices, and in our peace offerings, and that your children should not say\\nto our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the Lord.\\n28 Therefore said we, If so be that they should so say to us or to our generations\\nin time to come, then will we answer, Behold the fashion of the altar of the Lord,\\nwhich our fathers made, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice, but it is a witness\\nbetween us and you.\\n29 God forbid, that we should rebel against the Lord, and turn this day away from\\nthe Lord to build an altar for burnt offering, or for meat offering, or for sacrifice,\\nsave the altar of the Lord our God, that is before his Tabernacle.\\n30 And when Phinehas the Priest, and the princes of the Congregation and\\nheads over the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words, that\\nthe children of Reuben, and children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh\\nspake, they were well content.\\n31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the Priest said unto the children of Reuben\\nand to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we\\nperceive, that the Lord is among us, because ye have not done this trespass\\nagainst the Lord: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of\\nthe Lord.\\n32 Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the Priest with the princes returned from the\\nchildren of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto\\nthe land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them answer.\\n33 And the saying pleased the children of Israel: and the children of Israel\\nblessed God, and minded not to go against them in battle, for to destroy the land,\\nwherein the children of Reuben, and Gad dwelt.\\n34 Then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it\\nshall be a witness between us, that the Lord is God.\\nJoshua 23\\n1 And a long season after that the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their\\nenemies round about, and Joshua was old, and stricken in age,\\n2 Then Joshua called all Israel, and their Elders, and their heads, and their\\njudges, and their officers, and said unto them, I am old, and stricken in age.\\n3 Also ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these nations\\nbefore you, how the Lord your God himself hath fought for you.\\n4 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an\\ninheritance according to your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have\\ndestroyed, even unto the great Sea Westward.\\n5 And the Lord your God shall expel them before you, and cast them out of your\\nsight, and ye shall possess their land, as the Lord your God hath said unto you.\\n6 Be ye therefore of a valiant courage, to observe and do all that is written in the\\nbook of the Law of Moses, that ye turn not there from to the right hand nor to the\\nleft,\\n7 Neither company with these nations: that is, with them which are left with you,\\nneither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them,\\nneither serve them nor bow unto them:\\n8 But stick fast unto the Lord your God, as ye have done unto this day.\\n9 For ye Lord hath cast out before you great nations and mighty, and no man\\nhath stood before your face hitherto.\\n10 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord your God, he fighteth for\\nyou, as he hath promised you.\\n11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the Lord your God.\\n12 Else, if ye go back, and cleave unto the rest of these nations: that is, of them\\nthat remain with you, and shall make marriages with them, and go unto them,\\nand they to you,\\n13 Know ye for certain, that the Lord your God will cast out no more of these\\nnations from before you: but they shall be a snare and destruction unto you, and\\na whip on your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish out of this good\\nland, which ye Lord your God hath given you.\\n14 And behold, this day do I enter into the way of all ye world, and ye know in all\\nyour hearts and in all your souls, that nothing hath failed of all the good things\\nwhich the Lord your God promised you, but all are come to pass unto you:\\nnothing hath failed thereof.\\n15 Therefore as all good things are come upon you, which the Lord your God\\npromised you, so shall the Lord bring upon you every evil thing, until he have\\ndestroyed you out of this good land, which ye Lord your God hath given you.\\n16 When ye shall transgress the covenant of the Lord your God, which he\\ncommanded you, and shall go and serve other gods, and bow yourselves to\\nthem, then shall the wrath of the Lord wax hot against you, and ye shall perish\\nquickly out of the good land which he hath given you.\\nJoshua 24\\n1 And Joshua assembled again all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called the\\nElders of Israel, and their heads, and their judges, and their officers, and they\\npresented themselves before God.\\n2 Then Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your\\nfathers dwelt beyond the flood in old time, even Terah the father of Abraham, and\\nthe father of Nachor, and served other gods.\\n3 And I took your father Abraham from beyond the flood, and brought him\\nthrough all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.\\n4 And I gave unto Isaac, Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to\\npossess it: but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.\\n5 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt: and when I had so done\\namong them, I brought you out.\\n6 So I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and ye came unto the Sea, and the\\nEgyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red\\nSea.\\n7 Then they cried unto the Lord, and he put a darkness between you and the\\nEgyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them: so your eyes\\nhave seen what I have done in Egypt also ye dwelt in the wilderness a long\\nseason.\\n8 After, I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt beyond Jordan,\\nand they fought with you: but I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their\\ncountry, and I destroyed them out of your sight.\\n9 Also Balak the son of Zippor King of Moab arose and warred against Israel,\\nand sent to call Balaam the son of Beor for to curse you,\\n10 But I would not hear Balaam: therefore he blessed you, and I delivered you\\nout of his hand.\\n11 And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho, and the men of Jericho\\nfought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the\\nHittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, and I delivered them\\ninto your hand.\\n12 And I sent hornets before you, which cast them out before you, even the two\\nkings of the Amorites, and not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.\\n13 And I have given you a land, wherein ye did not labor, and cities which ye built\\nnot, and ye dwell in them, and eat of the vineyards and olive trees, which ye\\nplanted not.\\n14 Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in uprightness and in truth, and put\\naway the gods, which your fathers served beyond the flood and in Egypt, and\\nserve the Lord.\\n15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye\\nwill serve, whether the gods which your fathers served (that were beyond the\\nflood) or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but I and mine house\\nwill serve the Lord.\\n16 Then the people answered and said, God forbid, that we should forsake the\\nLord, to serve other gods.\\n17 For the Lord our God, he brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt,\\nfrom the house of bondage, and he did those great miracles in our sight, and\\npreserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the people through\\nwhom we came.\\n18 And the Lord did cast out before us all the people, even the Amorites which\\ndwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the Lord, for he is our God.\\n19 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the Lord: for he is an holy\\nGod: he is a jealous God: he will not pardon your iniquity nor your sins.\\n20 If ye forsake the Lord and serve strange gods, then he will return and bring\\nevil upon you, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.\\n21 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay, but we will serve the Lord.\\n22 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves, that\\nye have chosen you the Lord, to serve him: and they said, We are witnesses.\\n23 Then put away now, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and bow\\nyour hearts unto the Lord God of Israel.\\n24 And ye people said unto Joshua, The Lord our God will we serve, and his\\nvoice will we obey.\\n25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people the same day, and gave them an\\nordinance and law in Shechem.\\n26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the Law of God, and took a\\ngreat stone, and pitched it there under an oak that was in the Sanctuary of the\\nLord.\\n27 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto\\nus: for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which he spake with us: it shall be\\ntherefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.\\n28 Then Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.\\n29 And after these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord died,\\nbeing an hundred and ten years old.\\n30 And they buried him in ye border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is\\nin mount Ephraim, on the Northside of mount Gaash.\\n31 And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the\\nElders that over lived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the Lord that\\nhe had done for Israel.\\n32 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt,\\nburied they in Shechem in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of\\nHamor the father of Shechem, for an hundred pieces of silver, and the children of\\nJoseph had them in their inheritance.\\n33 Also Eleazar the son of Aaron died, whom they buried in the hill of Phinehas\\nhis son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.
